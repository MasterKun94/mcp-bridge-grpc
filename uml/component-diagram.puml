title gRPC MCP Bridge Component Diagram

' Define components
[LLM] as LLM
[MCP Client] as McpClient
[MCP Bridge] as McpBridge
[gRPC Server] as GrpcServer

' Define relationships
LLM <--> McpClient : "Natural Language\nInteraction"
McpClient <--> McpBridge : "MCP Protocol"
McpBridge <--> GrpcServer : "gRPC Protocol"

' Add notes
note top of LLM
  Large Language Model
  Processes natural language
  and decides which tools to call
end note

note top of McpClient
  Client application that
  interfaces with the LLM
end note

note top of McpBridge
  Converts between MCP and gRPC
  protocols, enabling LLM to
  call gRPC services
end note

note top of GrpcServer
  Provides business logic
  through gRPC services
end note

' Add flow description
note bottom
  Data Flow:
  1. User sends request to MCP Client
  2. MCP Client forwards to LLM
  3. LLM decides to call a tool via MCP Bridge
  4. MCP Bridge converts request to gRPC format
  5. gRPC Server processes request and returns result
  6. Result flows back through the same path to user
